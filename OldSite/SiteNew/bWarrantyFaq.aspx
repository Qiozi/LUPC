            <h4>What is the warranty on products you sell?
            </h4>
            <div>
                <p>
                    LU Computers warrants its products against defects in material and workmanship under
                    normal use for a specified duration of time beginning from the date of original
                    purchase. All computer systems come with one year parts and labour warranty. LU
                    Computers provide life time technical support to computer system buyers. LU Computers
                    will either replace or repair the product at no charge for parts and labour. Please
                    check details of each product for exact duration of the warranty for that product.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Why should I purchase a warranty extension?
            </h4>
            <div>
                <p>
                    An extended warranty ensures that you get the maximum value from your purchase.
                    You sustain no additional cost per repair incident, no matter how many times you
                    utilize your warranty. Just one repair performed out of warranty can cost several
                    times more than the cost of an extended warranty.
                </p>
            </div>
            <h4>What is your free warranty upgrade to 3 years on parts and labour?
