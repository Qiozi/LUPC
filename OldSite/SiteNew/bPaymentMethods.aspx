            <p>
                Via PayPal you can pay all major credit cards, bank transfers online.&nbsp; You
                    shop on lucomputers.com and pay PayPal on lucomputers.com which is really easy.
                    PayPal is the most popular online payment. You can pay with PayPal even you don't
                    have a PayPal account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note Lu Computers ships merchandise only to a <b>PAYPAL CONFIRMED ADDRESS</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>A confirmed address</b> is an address that has been reviewed by PayPal and found
                    to be safe based on information related to the address. For example, a credit card
                    billing address is confirmed because PayPal can check that the address is the same
                    as the address on file at the credit card company.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Here's how you can confirm your shipping address: </b>Add a credit card to your
                    PayPal account. By adding a credit card to your account, PayPal can attempt to confirm
                    your address with your credit card company. If the credit card company is not able
                    to confirm your address, you may be asked to complete the Expanded Use enrollment
                    process to activate your credit card. Your address can be confirmed after that process
                    is complete. Note: Not all credit card companies are able to confirm addresses.
